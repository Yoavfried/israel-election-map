# Public Election Data

The repository includes a versioned, ready-to-download data release under
[`public-data/v1`](v1/). You do not need to run the pipeline to use these files.

The release contains all 96,529 normalized K17-K25 ballot-result rows, separate
polygon aggregates, full-resolution geography packages, election and party
metadata, row-level assignment provenance, checksums, and a machine-readable
validation report. The ballot-table contract is schema version 2.

## Download One Election

Each ballot CSV contains every source result row for that election, one column
per registered ballot letter, and both statistical-area and locality join IDs.

Other election-specific downloads are organized under
[`aggregates/custom-geographies`](v1/aggregates/custom-geographies/),
[`aggregates/envelopes`](v1/aggregates/envelopes/), and
[`aggregates/unresolved`](v1/aggregates/unresolved/).

## Geography Packages

Each ZIP contains full-resolution GeoJSON and a CSV with the same feature
metadata. Every feature exposes `properties.geography_id`.

| Package | Features | Archive | Metadata only |
|---|---:|---|---|
| 1995 statistical areas | 2,661 | [ZIP](v1/geographies/statistical_areas_1995.zip?raw=1) | [CSV](v1/geographies/statistical_areas_1995.csv?raw=1) |
| 2008 statistical areas | 3,030 | [ZIP](v1/geographies/statistical_areas_2008.zip?raw=1) | [CSV](v1/geographies/statistical_areas_2008.csv?raw=1) |
| 2011 statistical areas | 3,115 | [ZIP](v1/geographies/statistical_areas_2011.zip?raw=1) | [CSV](v1/geographies/statistical_areas_2011.csv?raw=1) |
| 2022 statistical areas | 3,857 | [ZIP](v1/geographies/statistical_areas_2022.zip?raw=1) | [CSV](v1/geographies/statistical_areas_2022.csv?raw=1) |
| 2022 locality footprints | 1,387 | [ZIP](v1/geographies/localities_2022.zip?raw=1) | [CSV](v1/geographies/localities_2022.csv?raw=1) |
| Historical/reviewed locality composites | 104 | [ZIP](v1/geographies/composite_localities.zip?raw=1) | [CSV](v1/geographies/composite_localities.csv?raw=1) |
| Reviewed custom geographies | 2 | [ZIP](v1/geographies/custom_geographies.zip?raw=1) | [CSV](v1/geographies/custom_geographies.csv?raw=1) |

Use [`metadata/geographies.csv`](v1/metadata/geographies.csv?raw=1) as the
combined lookup from any `geography_id` to its geometry archive.

## Join Rules

- Statistical ballot assignment: `ballots/*.csv.stat_area_id` equals
  `GeoJSON.properties.geography_id` in the election's statistical package.
- Locality ballot assignment: `ballots/*.csv.locality_geography_id` equals
  `metadata/geographies.csv.geography_id`; `geometry_archive` identifies the
  package containing the feature.
- Polygon aggregates: every geographic aggregate CSV has a standard
  `geography_id` column that equals `GeoJSON.properties.geography_id`.
- Blank statistical IDs are intentional unresolved source gaps. Envelope rows
  are national non-geographic results and do not join to a polygon.

See the [data dictionary](DATA_DICTIONARY.md) for column-level definitions and
short pandas/QGIS examples.

## Assignment Provenance

Every ballot row exposes:

- `assignment_evidence_class`;
- `assignment_confidence`;
- `assignment_is_synthetic_link`;
- the specific `final_assignment_method` and `final_assignment_source`.

The release contains 198 inferred ballot-to-area links representing 58,829
actual voters: 134 from official CBS stable-ballot evidence, nine from reviewed
exact ArcGIS residuals, five reviewed cross-election corrections, and 50
approved high-confidence polling-register continuity links. The ballot
identity, electorate, turnout, valid/invalid totals, and party votes remain
unchanged official source values. Only the area link is synthetic.

The separate 74 K23 AGS assignments are direct official evidence and are not
marked synthetic. Users who require no inferred links can filter
`assignment_is_synthetic_link=false` and reaggregate the ballot rows.

The complete evidence tables, accepted and rejected decisions, conflicts,
source-schema inventory, unresolved-row classification, and polygon coverage
audit are under
[`metadata/assignment-provenance`](v1/metadata/assignment-provenance/).

## Metadata And Integrity

- [`metadata/elections.csv`](v1/metadata/elections.csv?raw=1) lists election
  years, active statistical vintages, and principal paths.
- [`metadata/parties.csv`](v1/metadata/parties.csv?raw=1) maps each
  election/ballot-letter combination to its reviewed list name and article
  metadata.
- [`metadata/coverage.csv`](v1/metadata/coverage.csv?raw=1) reports mapped and
  pending coverage by election.
- [`metadata/assignment-provenance`](v1/metadata/assignment-provenance/)
  contains 30 source, decision, conflict, gap, and polygon-audit artifacts.
- [`manifest.csv`](v1/manifest.csv?raw=1) and
  [`manifest.json`](v1/manifest.json?raw=1) contain file sizes, row counts, and
  SHA-256 checksums.
- [`validation.json`](v1/validation.json?raw=1) records the release checks.

CSVs are UTF-8 with a byte-order mark for reliable Hebrew display in spreadsheet
software. The release is generated by `scripts/build_public_data_release.py` and
must not be edited by hand.

## Data Versus Map Presentation

This release publishes election facts, reviewed party/list metadata, assignment
provenance, and geometry. It deliberately excludes map colors, concise UI label
overrides, layout, and interaction configuration. Those are presentation choices
owned by the map application under `web/app/`.

The map groups the K19-K25 tribal statistical-area results into one combined
tribal marker because the available derivative footprints overlap surrounding
areas and cannot be treated as exclusive geography. The release tables do not
collapse those records: exact tribe statistical-area identifiers, results, and
assignment provenance remain available for analysis.

When an election/locality has no supported ballot-to-area assignment, the map
can show its whole-locality aggregate on a display-only locality boundary with
an info notice. This does not assign any ballot or change coverage. The 308
map substitutions and their represented totals are disclosed in
[`historical_municipality_display_fallbacks.csv`](v1/metadata/assignment-provenance/historical_municipality_display_fallbacks.csv?raw=1).
