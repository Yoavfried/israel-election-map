# Product Feature Plan

Last updated: 2026-07-17

This document records the intended design and delivery order for future map
features. It is not a completion tracker. Actual complete/in-progress state is
maintained only in `docs/PROJECT_STATUS.md`.

## Delivery Order

Search may proceed before the remaining data, party-color, and Wikipedia-link
audits are closed. It uses the published geography catalog and must clearly
handle areas with no mapped result. Statistical assignment work continues in
parallel; closing a source gap never means forcing a ballot onto a polygon.

Current priority:

1. locality and statistical-area search;
2. complete the map's party-color assignments;
3. complete the Wikipedia-link audit;
4. national results;
5. single-party map mode;
6. two-party comparison mode;
7. satellite, OSM vector, and 3D-building basemaps at the same priority.

Responsive bilingual UX, accessibility, and regression QA are requirements for
every item, not a separate planned feature.

## Planned Features

### 1. Locality And Statistical-Area Search

Build an offline, election-aware search index from the map's own geography
catalog. Index Hebrew and English names, locality/statistical-area codes,
historical names, and reviewed aliases.

Expected behavior:

- accessible combobox with keyboard navigation and autocomplete;
- exact-code and exact-name results first, then prefix and tolerant normalized
  matches;
- results restricted or clearly labeled by the selected election and geography
  mode;
- selecting a result fits its bounds, highlights it, and opens its result panel;
- no network dependency for locality or statistical-area lookup.

### 2. National Results

Add an election-level national view alongside the geographic map modes.

Expected behavior:

- nationwide votes and valid-vote share for every list;
- the election's legally applicable electoral threshold and a clear indication
  of which lists crossed it;
- exact final mandate counts from the official result, not an undocumented
  approximation of seat allocation;
- envelope votes included in the national totals;
- Hebrew and English party names and reviewed article links where available.

### 3. Single-Party Map Mode

Allow one election-specific party/list to be selected. Polygon color is a
sequential gradient derived from that party's reviewed base color: stronger
color means a higher share of valid votes and weaker color means a lower share.

Expected behavior:

- election-aware party search because ballot letters can change meaning;
- a numeric legend with a stated percentage domain;
- selecting a polygon still opens the complete area result;
- an optional circle mode where circle size represents that party's vote count
  and color represents its vote share;
- zero, missing, and statistically unresolved results remain distinguishable.

### 4. Two-Party Comparison

Allow two election-specific parties to define the two ends of a diverging
color scale. Each polygon receives a mixed color based on the local balance
between the selected parties.

Expected behavior:

- both selected parties and their base colors remain visible in the controls
  and legend;
- the comparison metric and neutral midpoint are stated explicitly;
- selecting a polygon opens the complete result while visually emphasizing the
  two compared parties;
- ties, zero votes for both parties, and missing results have explicit neutral
  states.

### 5. Basemap And 3D Suite

Satellite imagery, an OSM-derived vector basemap, and optional 3D buildings
share the same priority and follow the result-analysis modes above.

#### Satellite Basemap

Add a basemap selector with the existing neutral map and a satellite option.
Election polygons remain an interactive overlay rather than becoming part of
the imagery.

Required behavior:

- configurable raster-tile source rather than a hard-coded provider URL;
- visible provider/data attribution;
- polygon fill-opacity control so imagery remains inspectable;
- labels and boundaries remain legible over bright and dark imagery;
- provider terms, API-key handling, cost, caching, and Israel coverage reviewed
  before selection.

No satellite provider is selected yet. Esri/other commercial imagery must not be
used merely because an unauthenticated tile URL happens to work.

#### OpenStreetMap Vector Basemap And 3D Buildings

Add an OSM-derived vector basemap beneath the election polygons. OpenFreeMap is
a candidate because it exposes a MapLibre style and OSM-derived vector tiles;
self-hosted regional PMTiles remain the stronger long-term control option.

Expected behavior:

- streets, labels, POIs, and building footprints visible beneath results;
- optional 3D mode at close zoom using MapLibre `fill-extrusion` and available
  building height/min-height attributes;
- pitch/bearing controls appear only when 3D mode is active;
- election polygons, hover state, and click targets remain visually dominant;
- reduced-motion and low-performance fallbacks disable unnecessary extrusion;
- attribution is always visible.

Do not treat the community `tile.openstreetmap.org` or
`vector.openstreetmap.org` servers as an unlimited production backend. Their
policies require attribution and caching and prohibit bulk downloading. Tile
hosting must remain replaceable configuration.

## Technical Sequence

1. Build and test the local geography search index and accessible combobox.
2. Complete the color and Wikipedia metadata audits.
3. Add national result data and the national results view.
4. Add single-party polygon and circle presentation modes.
5. Add the two-party comparison mode.
6. Add a replaceable basemap/source abstraction without changing result IDs.
7. Add neutral/OSM/satellite selection, overlay opacity, and close-zoom 3D.
8. Run desktop/mobile, Hebrew/English, keyboard, performance, attribution, and
   result-click regression tests for every stage.
