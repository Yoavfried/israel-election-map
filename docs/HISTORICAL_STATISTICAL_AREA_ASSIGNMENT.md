# Historical Statistical-Area Assignment

Last updated: 2026-07-18

## Decision

Statistical-area results represent the areas assigned to each ballot register.
The project starts from official ballot-to-area evidence and leaves a row
unresolved when no source supports a unique area.

Assignment precedence is:

1. official envelope or reviewed non-geographic handling;
2. reviewed historical override where independent evidence disproves a direct
   crosswalk target;
3. official election-specific CBS ballot crosswalk;
4. direct K23 CEC AGS evidence;
5. reviewed exact ArcGIS residual reconstruction;
6. official CBS stable-ballot propagation when all same-vintage evidence agrees;
7. election-vintage locality fallback only when one area exists;
8. reviewed custom geography where no historical area is supported;
9. unresolved.

No assignment is accepted from a merely similar ballot number, an approximate
aggregate match, or a polling-place location.

## Election Vintages

| Election | Year | Area vintage | Official crosswalk |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| K17 | 2006 | 1995 | `Kalpi2006_stat1995.xls` |
| K18 | 2009 | 2008 | `kalpi2008_stat2008.xlsx` |
| K19 | 2013 | 2011 | `kalpi2013_stat2011.xlsx` |
| K20 | 2015 | 2011 | `kalpi2015_stat2011.xlsx` |
| K21 | Apr 2019 | 2011 | `kalpi_April2019_stat2011.xlsx` |
| K22 | Sep 2019 | 2011 | `kalpi_September2019_stat2011.xlsx` |
| K23 | 2020 | 2011 | `kalpi_March2020_stat2011.xlsx` |
| K24 | 2021 | 2011 | `kalpi_March2021_stat2011.xlsx` |
| K25 | 2022 | 2011 | `kalpi_November2022_stat2011.xlsx` |

K25 deliberately stays on 2011 areas. Its official crosswalk targets 2011, and
at least 3,543 directly assigned K25 rows point to 2011 areas that split across
multiple 2022 areas. A future election should use 2022 geometry only when an
official 2022 ballot crosswalk exists.

## Source Inventory

`scripts/fetch_cbs_historical_geography.py` enumerates the public CBS GIS
catalog, downloads the nine crosswalks, seven stable-ballot workbooks, three
historical geometry vintages, and transition tables, verifies signatures and
sizes, and writes a SHA-256 manifest.

`scripts/audit_election_source_geography_fields.py` audits the available source
schemas. The downloaded CBS catalog contains exactly one in-scope direct
crosswalk for each K17-K25 election and one stability workbook for each
transition ending K19-K25. No alternate in-scope ballot-geography workbook is
listed. Among the archived K20-K25 CEC polling-place reports, only K23 contains
an AGS field.

The machine-readable inventory is published as
`metadata/assignment-provenance/election_source_geography_field_audit.*`.

## Evidence Paths

### Official Direct Crosswalks

The nine CBS crosswalks provide 83,237 final row assignments. K17 tenths
encoding and later decimal subdivisions are normalized explicitly:

- in K17, `10` means ballot 1, while values such as `61` and `62` are
  subdivisions of ballot 6;
- in later elections, subdivisions such as `1.1` and `1.2` inherit a direct
  base-ballot target when the official crosswalk maps ballot 1;
- the crosswalk's combined area ID is authoritative even when it crosses the
  result row's locality boundary;
- `Stat08_Unite` and `Stat11_Ref` are demographic reference fields, not
  instructions to merge election areas.

Five K19 targets contradicted independent same-vintage evidence. Reviewed rows
in `data/manual/historical_stat_area_overrides.csv` replace those links using
adjacent-election and ArcGIS evidence. They are labeled synthetic corrections,
not silently presented as direct crosswalk rows.

### K23 Direct AGS

The official K23 CEC report supplies AGS for 6,849 ballot keys. Against 6,776
rows already assigned by the CBS crosswalk, 6,775 agree and one contradicts.
The contradiction is withheld. The remaining direct AGS evidence assigns 74
previously pending rows representing 29,685 actual voters.

These links use `assignment_evidence_class=official_direct_ags` and are not
synthetic. Full validation, conflicts, candidates, and hashes are published
under `metadata/assignment-provenance/k23_cec_ags_*`.

### Official Stable-Ballot Workbooks

The seven CBS transition workbooks identify ballot registers treated as stable
between elections. A pending row is propagated only when every assigned member
of its same-vintage stability component agrees on one area. Decimal
subdivisions are evaluated through the historical base ballot.

This adds 134 links representing 35,129 actual voters:

| Election | Rows | Actual voters |
|---|---:|---:|
| K19 | 2 | 537 |
| K20 | 43 | 16,676 |
| K22 | 1 | 344 |
| K24 | 87 | 17,082 |
| K25 | 1 | 490 |

One same-vintage conflict and 105 conflicts crossing a statistical-area
vintage transition are withheld. Stable-ballot links are high-confidence
inferences, not direct election-specific crosswalk rows.

### ArcGIS Residual Reconstruction

The 2015 and April 2019 FeatureServer layers can validate or reconstruct some
K20/K21 area totals, but their item descriptions explicitly state that
statistical areas in Arab localities were merged and that the election product
is not official. A locality-wide feature is therefore never treated as a
detailed statistical area.

The audit classifies every feature before arithmetic:

| Election | Detailed or single-area records | Dissolved locality aggregates |
|---|---:|---:|
| K20 | 2,826 | 35 |
| K21 | 2,655 | 34 |

Sixty-five reviewed locality decisions were rejected after this metadata check,
and one military/non-geographic candidate was rejected. K20 has no accepted
ArcGIS reconstruction. K21 has two accepted exact decisions:

| Tier | Locality | Rows | Actual voters | Basis |
|---|---|---:|---:|---|
| A | Ar'ara-BaNegev | 3 | 965 | Unique exact residual across ballot, eligible, actual, valid, invalid, and party totals. |
| C | Jerusalem | 6 | 2,634 | One isolated residual area matches exactly; unrelated zero-ballot source deltas remain documented. |

Tier B/C approval was permission to use defensible evidence, not permission to
accept a 1-3 vote discrepancy. No tolerance-based Tier B row is published.
ArcGIS party vectors and vote totals are never copied into election results.

### Single-Area And Custom Rules

A locality fallback is allowed only when the active historical geography has
exactly one canonical area. This assigns 3,788 rows. K17/K18 tribal and Hebron
cases retain 92 reviewed custom-marker rows because their active historical
geometry cannot distinguish the later 2011 areas.

## Published Provenance Classes

| Evidence class | Rows | Synthetic link |
|---|---:|---|
| `official_direct_crosswalk` | 83,237 | No |
| `official_direct_ags` | 74 | No |
| `deterministic_single_area_locality` | 3,788 | No |
| `official_stability_inferred_link` | 134 | Yes |
| `reviewed_exact_aggregate_inferred_link` | 9 | Yes |
| `reviewed_cross_election_inferred_link` | 5 | Yes |
| `reviewed_custom_geography` | 92 | No |
| `non_geographic` | 3,585 | No |
| `unresolved` | 5,605 | No |
| **Total** | **96,529** | |

Every public ballot row carries `assignment_evidence_class`,
`assignment_confidence`, and `assignment_is_synthetic_link`, together with the
more specific method and source fields.

## Current Coverage

Coverage is the share of actual voters in geographic scope with a supported
statistical-mode target. Reviewed K17/K18 custom markers count as supported map
targets; envelopes and other non-geographic rows are outside the denominator.

| Election | Vintage | Supported rows | Pending rows | Pending actual voters | Supported voter share |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| K17 | 1995 | 7,859 | 415 | 160,216 | 94.68% |
| K18 | 2008 | 8,740 | 519 | 189,711 | 94.13% |
| K19 | 2011 | 9,311 | 564 | 214,251 | 94.08% |
| K20 | 2011 | 9,521 | 591 | 269,029 | 93.31% |
| K21 | 2011 | 9,854 | 598 | 225,160 | 94.51% |
| K22 | 2011 | 9,920 | 611 | 266,046 | 93.64% |
| K23 | 2011 | 10,004 | 619 | 297,152 | 93.06% |
| K24 | 2011 | 11,248 | 871 | 212,701 | 94.70% |
| K25 | 2011 | 10,882 | 817 | 263,243 | 93.92% |

The 5,605 pending rows are fully classified:

- 5,349 belong to entire localities omitted from an official crosswalk;
- 99 belong to localities absent from the active historical geography;
- 57 are in a K17 historical composite municipality without a crosswalk;
- 70 are central ballot 990 rows intentionally retained at locality level;
- 30 are specific ordinary ballots omitted from an otherwise present locality.

Every specific omission was checked against normalized crosswalk keys, K23 AGS,
stable-ballot components, and applicable ArcGIS evidence. The remaining gaps
are irreducible with the currently recovered sources. They are published, not
estimated, in `historical_assignment_gap_rows.csv`.

## Geometry Provenance

`scripts/build_historical_geographies.py` builds canonical assignment geometry
and separate display geometry.

| Vintage | Canonical features | Use |
|---:|---:|---|
| 1995 | 2,660 | K17 |
| 2008 | 3,030 | K18 |
| 2011 | 3,115 | K19-K25 |
| 2022 | 3,857 | Future direct-crosswalk election and independent analysis |

Canonical geometry is official CBS geometry except for 33 documented targets:

- `stat1995:9400008` is an official 1995-to-2008 transition-key union;
- 32 2011 targets absent from the downloaded CBS FileGDB use exact-ID geometry
  from the audited ArcGIS layers.

Detailed West Bank ArcGIS footprints otherwise remain display derivatives.
Replacement footprints are clipped against historical neighbors; K17/K18
preserve shared boundaries, and materially overlapping non-exclusive
supplements render as markers. Election votes never come from geometry files.

The polygon audit reports zero assigned IDs without geometry and zero
unassigned detailed K20/K21 ArcGIS polygons carrying an official electorate
after dissolved locality totals and special rows are classified correctly.
Population fields attached to historical geometry are demographic proxies, not
election-specific eligible-voter counts.

For the 2011 vintage, 2,405 polygons receive an assignment in every supported
election, 358 are intermittent, 75 are never assigned but have a positive
population proxy, and 277 are never assigned without one. Those last two
categories are audit leads, not proof that a separate ballot result should
exist.
