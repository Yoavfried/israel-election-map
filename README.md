# Israel Election Map

Bilingual web map and reproducible data pipeline for exploring K17-K25 Knesset
election results by locality and election-appropriate statistical area.

The repository contains a Python data pipeline, a React/TypeScript/MapLibre
client, and a committed public-data release. Statistical results use direct CBS
ballot-to-area evidence where available, additional official AGS and
stable-ballot evidence, explicitly labeled reviewed inference, and matching
historical geometry.

## Download The Data

Ready-to-use files are committed under [`public-data/v1`](public-data/v1/). No
pipeline run is required.

The ballot CSVs contain every source result row, party-vote columns, and the
corresponding statistical-area and locality IDs. Polygon ZIPs expose the same
`geography_id`, so the join is direct. Assignment method/source fields identify
148 rows whose area link is inferred rather than copied from a direct official
crosswalk. Their vote values remain official, and the exact evidence class,
confidence, source, and synthetic-link flag are published on every row.

- [Data dictionary and join examples](public-data/DATA_DICTIONARY.md)
- [Machine-readable manifest and checksums](public-data/v1/manifest.csv?raw=1)

Map colors, UI labels, and interaction settings remain presentation
configuration under `web/app/`; they are not part of the reusable data tables.

## Geographic Assignment

Statistical-area assignment precedence is:

1. official envelope or reviewed non-geographic handling;
2. reviewed historical overrides where independent evidence disproves a direct
   crosswalk target;
3. official election-specific CBS ballot-to-statistical-area crosswalk;
4. direct K23 CEC AGS evidence;
5. reviewed exact ArcGIS residual reconstruction;
6. official CBS stable-ballot propagation when all same-vintage evidence agrees;
7. historical locality fallback only when that locality has one published area;
8. reviewed custom geography where no supported historical area exists;
9. explicit unresolved status.

Statistical mode uses 1995 areas for K17, 2008 for K18, and 2011 for K19-K25.
K25 remains on 2011 because its official crosswalk targets that vintage;
forcing those results onto 2022 areas would invent precision.

## Run Locally

The full pipeline depends on official source files that are not committed.
Start with [`docs/DATA_SOURCES.md`](docs/DATA_SOURCES.md) and
[`data/README.md`](data/README.md).

```powershell
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python scripts/fetch_cbs_historical_geography.py
python scripts/fetch_election_results.py
python scripts/run_pipeline.py
```

Reuse existing generated geometry with:

```powershell
python scripts/run_pipeline.py --skip-geographies
```

Run the web app:

```powershell
cd web/app
npm install
npm run dev
```

Vite serves the app at `http://localhost:4173`. The frontend compiler reads
`data/processed/` and writes validated assets under `web/app/public/data/v2/`.

## Documentation

- [`docs/PROJECT_STATUS.md`](docs/PROJECT_STATUS.md) is the only completion
  tracker.
- [`docs/FEATURE_PLAN.md`](docs/FEATURE_PLAN.md) records the product roadmap and delivery order.
- [`docs/HISTORICAL_STATISTICAL_AREA_ASSIGNMENT.md`](docs/HISTORICAL_STATISTICAL_AREA_ASSIGNMENT.md)
  documents source hierarchy, vintages, matching rules, and coverage.
- [`docs/LOCALITY_MODE.md`](docs/LOCALITY_MODE.md) documents locality
  aggregation, composites, result-presence evidence, and envelopes.
- [`docs/DATA_PIPELINE.md`](docs/DATA_PIPELINE.md) documents the reproducible
  stage order and outputs.
- [`docs/DATA_SOURCES.md`](docs/DATA_SOURCES.md) inventories election,
  geography, and party sources.
- [`web/app/docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](web/app/docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) defines the
  frontend data contract and product boundary.

## Repository Layout

- `public-data/` - committed, versioned data downloads and geography packages.
- `data/manual/` - committed reviewed corrections and assignment overrides.
- `data/raw/` and `data/processed/` - local source and generated working data,
  intentionally ignored by Git.
- `docs/` - methodology, source notes, and decisions.
- `scripts/` - ingestion, normalization, geography, assignment, QA,
  aggregation, and public-release generation.
- `web/app/` - Vite, React, TypeScript, and MapLibre client.
